These are some interesting things I've jotted down.


## Urbit
A distributed "solid state" interpreter that uses the [Nock](http://moronlab.blogspot.com/2010/01/nock-maxwells-equations-of-software.html) language spec to create (allegedly) a VM, OS, web server, and core apps. The idea seems to be to give the general public easy access to creating secure web servers since current systems are far too complicated.

They have a pretty ridiculous [white paper](https://media.urbit.org/whitepaper.pdf) riddled with random terminology that seems to be thrown in their for the sake of being complicated.

A note on the Urbit IDs: the limited 2^32 (~4B) Urbit IDs are created by artificial scarcity — which can be pretty useful in certain situations — however; this doesn't seem to be one of them. Additionally the fact that there are the same number of IDs as addresses in the legacy IPv4 makes some alarm bells go off in my head, since anyone in today's day and age with a long term vision for network software would choose 2^64 as the bare minimum when creating a limited address system. 

If you want to play with it [you can](https://urbit.org/getting-started), but it's currently not much more than a glamourised IRC.
